# PolycysticKidneySeg

3D Slicer extension for fully automated polycystic kidneys segmentation based on "pkdia" AI model developed by Pierre-Henri Conze (IMT Atlantique) and described in

## Tutorial

- Start 3D Slicer

- Go to `PolycysticKidneySeg` module

- Use `Install dependencies` button if needed

- Optional: Download provided CT and/or T2 sample data, automatically added to `Sample Data` module (section PolycysticKidneySeg Sample Files)

- Select desired modality (T2 by default)

- Select a loaded volume on which to perform the segmentation

- Click `Apply`

- The processing can take several minutes, after which the produced segmentation will be loaded in the open views
